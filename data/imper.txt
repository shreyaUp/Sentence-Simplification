Pass the salt.
Move out of my way!
Shut the front door.
Find my leather jacket.
Be there at five.
Clean your room.
Complete these by tomorrow.
Consider the red dress.
Wait for me.
Get out!
Make sure you pack warm clothes.
Choose Eamonn, not Seamus.
Please be quiet.
Be nice to your friends.
Play ball!
