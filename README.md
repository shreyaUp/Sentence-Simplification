# Sentence-Simplification
Complex sentences create difficulties in Machine translation. It has been noticed that whenever there are more than two clauses (verbs), the translated Hindi sentence 
shows implications in fluency and faithfulness.This project deals with :
1) Identifying English sentences with more than two clauses. 
2) Additionally marking the clause boundaries. 
3) Suggest strategy for breaking sentences with more than two clauses into multiple sentences, each sentence having no more than two clauses each.
